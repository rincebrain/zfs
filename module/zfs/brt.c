/*
 * Block Cloning design.
 *
 * Block Cloning allows to manually clone a file (or a subset of its blocks)
 * into another (or the same) file by just creating additional references to
 * the data blocks without copying the data itself. Those references are kept
 * in the Block Reference Tables (BRTs).
 *
 * In many ways this is similar to the existing deduplication, but there are
 * some important differences:
 *
 * - Deduplication is automatic and Block Cloning is not - one has to use a
 *   dedicated system call(s) to clone the given file/blocks.
 * - Deduplication keeps all data blocks in its table, even those referenced
 *   just ones. Block Cloning creates an entry in its tables only when there
 *   are at least two references to the given data block. If the block was
 *   never explicitly cloned or the second to last reference was dropped,
 *   there will be neither space nor performance overhead.
 * - Deduplication needs data to work - one needs to pass real data to the
 *   write(2) syscall, so hash can be calculated. Block Cloning doesn't require
 *   data, just block pointers to the data, so it is extremely fast, as we pay
 *   neither the cost of reading the data, nor the cost of writing the data -
 *   we operate exclusively on metadata.
 * - If the D (dedup) bit is not set in the block pointer, it means that
 *   the block is not in the dedup table (DDT) and we won't consult the DDT
 *   when we need to free the block. Block Cloning must be consulted on every
 *   free, because we cannot modify the source BP (eg. by setting something
 *   similar to the D bit), thus we have no hint if the block is in the
 *   Block Reference Table (BRT), so we need to look into the BRT. There is
 *   an optimization in place that allows to eliminate majority of BRT lookups
 *   that is described below in the "Minimizing free penalty" section.
 * - The BRT entry is much smaller than the DDT entry - for BRT we only store
 *   64bit offset and 64bit reference counter.
 * - Dedup keys are cryptographic hashes, so two blocks that are close to each
 *   other on disk are most likely in totally different parts of the DDT.
 *   The BRT entry keys are offsets into a single top-level VDEV, so data blocks
 *   from one file should have BRT entries close to each other.
 * - Scrub will only do a single pass over a block that is referenced multiple
 *   times in the DDT. Unfortunately it is not currently (if at all) possible
 *   with Block Cloning and block referenced multiple times will be scrubbed
 *   multiple times.
 * - Deduplication requires cryptographocally strong hash as a checksum or
 *   additional data verification. Block Cloning works with any checksum
 *   algorithm or even with checksumming disabled.
 *
 * As mentioned above, the BRT entries are much smaller than the DDT entries.
 * To uniquely identify a block we just need its vdevid and offset. We also
 * need to maintain a reference counter. The vdevid will often repeat, as there
 * is a small number of top-level VDEVs and a large number of blocks stored in
 * each VDEV. We take advantage of that to reduce the BRT entry size further by
 * maintaining one BRT for each top-level VDEV, so we can then have only offset
 * and counter as the BRT entry.
 *
 * Minimizing free penalty.
 *
 * Block Cloning allows to clone any existing block. When we free a block there
 * is no hint in the block pointer wether the block was cloned or not, so on
 * each free we have to check if there is a corresponding entry in the BRT or
 * not. If there is, we need to decrease the reference counter. Doing BRT
 * lookup on every free can potentially be expensive by requiring additional
 * I/Os if the BRT doesn't fit into memory. This is the main problem with
 * deduplication, so we've learn our lesson and try not to repeat the same
 * mistake here. How do we do that? We divide each top-level VDEV into 1GB
 * regions. For each region we maintain a reference counter that is a sum of
 * all reference counters of the cloned blocks that have offsets within the
 * region. This creates the regions array of 64bit numbers for each top-level
 * VDEV. The regions array is always kept in memory and updated on disk in the
 * same transaction group as the BRT updates to keep everything in-sync. We can
 * keep the array in memory, because it is very small. With 1GB regions and 1TB
 * VDEV the array requires only 8kB of memory (we may decide to decrease the
 * region size in the future). Now, when we want to free a block, we first
 * consult the array. If the counter for the whole region is zero, there is no
 * need to look for the BRT entry, as there isn't one for sure. If the counter
 * for the region is greater than zero, only then we will do a BRT lookup and
 * if an entry is found we will decrease the reference counters in the entry
 * and in the regions array.
 *
 * The regions array is small, but can potentially be larger for very large
 * VDEVs or smaller regions. In this case we don't want to rewrite entire array
 * on every change. We then divide the regions array into 128kB chunks and keep
 * a bitmap of dirty chunks within a transaction group. When we sync the
 * transaction group we can only update the parts of the regions array that
 * were modified. Note: Keeping track of the dirty parts of the regions array
 * is implemented, but updating only parts of the regions array on disk is not
 * yet implemented - for now we will update entire regions array if there was
 * any change.
 *
 * The implementation tries to be economic: if BRT is not used, or no longer
 * used, there will be no entries in the MOS and no additional memory used (eg.
 * the regions array is only allocated if needed).
 *
 * Interaction between Deduplication and Block Cloning.
 *
 * If both functionalities are in use, we could end up with a block that is
 * referenced multiple times in both DDT and BRT. When we free one of the
 * references we couldn't tell where it belongs, so we would have to decide
 * what table takes the precedence: do we first clear DDT references or BRT
 * references? To avoid this dilemma BRT cooperates with DDT - if a given block
 * is being cloned using BRT and the BP has the D (dedup) bit set, BRT will
 * lookup DDT entry and increase the counter there. No BRT entry will be
 * created for a block that resides on a dataset with deduplication turned on.
 * BRT may be more efficient for manual deduplication, but if the block is
 * already in the DDT, then creating additional BRT entry would be less
 * efficient. This clever idea was proposed by Allan Jude.
 *
 * Block Cloning across datasets.
 *
 * Block Cloning is not limited to cloning blocks within the same dataset.
 * It is possible (and very useful) to clone blocks between different datasets.
 * One use case is recovering files from snapshots. By cloning the files into
 * dataset we need no additional storage. Without Block Cloning we would need
 * additional space for those files.
 * Another interesting use case is moving the files between datasets
 * (copying the file content to the new dataset and removing the source file).
 * In that case Block Cloning will only be used briefly, because the BRT entries
 * will be removed when the source is removed.
 * Note: currently it is not possible to clone blocks between encrypted
 * datasets, even if those datasets use the same encryption key (this includes
 * snapshots of encrypted datasets). Cloning blocks between datasets that use
 * the same keys should be possible and should be implemented in the future.
 *
 * Block Cloning flow through ZFS layers.
 *
 * Note: Block Cloning can be used both for cloning file system blocks and ZVOL
 * blocks. As of this writting no interface is implemented that allows for ZVOL
 * blocks cloning.
 * Depending on the operating system there might be different interfaces to
 * clone blocks. On FreeBSD we have two syscalls:
 *
 *	ssize_t fclonefile(int srcfd, int dstfd);
 *	ssize_t fclonerange(int srcfd, off_t srcoffset, size_t length,
 *	                    int dstfd, off_t dstoffset);
 *
 * Even though fclonerange() takes byte offsets and length, they have to be
 * block-aligned.
 * Both syscalls call OS-independent zfs_clone_range() function. This function
 * was implemented based on zfs_write(), but instead of writing the given data
 * we first read block pointers using the new dmu_brt_readbps() function from
 * the source file. Once we have BPs from the source file we call the
 * dmu_brt_addref() function on the destination file. This function allocates
 * BPs for us. We interate over all source BPs. If the given BP is a hole or
 * an embedded block, we just copy BP. If it points to a real data we place
 * this BP on a BRT pending list using the brt_pending_add() function.
 *
 * We use this pending list to keep track of all BPs that got new references
 * within this transaction group.
 *
 * Some special cases to consider and how we address them:
 * - The block we want to clone may have been created within the same
 *   transaction group as we are trying to clone. Such block has no BP allocated
 *   yet, so it is too early to clone it - we return an error.
 * - The block we want to clone may have been modified within the same
 *   transaction group. We could potentially clone the previous version of the
 *   data, but that doesn't seem right. We treat it as the previous case and
 *   return an error.
 * - A block may be cloned multiple times during one transaction group (that's
 *   why pending list is actually a tree and not an append-only list - this
 *   way we can figure out faster if this block is cloned for the first time
 *   in this txg or consecutive time).
 * - A block may be cloned and freed within the same transaction group
 *   (see dbuf_undirty()).
 * - A block may be cloned and within the same transaction group the clone
 *   can be cloned again (see dmu_brt_readbps()).
 *
 * When we free a block we have additional step in the ZIO pipeline where we
 * call the zio_brt_free() function. We then call the brt_entry_decref()
 * that loads the corresponding BRT entry (if one exists) and decreases
 * reference counter. If this is not the last reference we will stop ZIO
 * pipeline here. If this is the last reference or the block is not in the
 * BRT, we countinue the pipeline and free the block as usual.
 *
 * At the begining of spa_sync() where there can be no more block cloning,
 * but before issuing frees we call brt_pending_apply(). This function applies
 * all the new clones to the BRT table - we load BRT entries and update
 * reference counters. To sync new BRT entries to disk, we use brt_sync()
 * function. This function will sync all dirty per-top-level-vdev BRTs,
 * regions arrays, etc.
 *
 * Block Cloning and ZIL.
 *
 * Every clone operation is divided into chunks (similar to write) and each
 * chunk is cloned in a separate transaction. To keep ZIL entries small,
 * each chunk clones at most 254 blocks, which makes ZIL entry to be 32kB.
